# pong-game
A Pong clone written in Rust.

This project was implemented using the great 2D game framework [tetra](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/) and was inspired from the
awesome [pong-tutorial](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/tutorial).
Big thanks to the developers of _**tetra**_ and the _**pong-tutorial**_.
